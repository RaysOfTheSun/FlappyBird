# FlappyBird
* This is a reacreation of the game [`Flappy Bird`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flappy_Bird) using _python_ and _pygame_.
# Notes
* This project used libraries such as [`Pygame`](https://www.pygame.org/news) and [`Pathlib`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html).
* This is the first actual game that I've coded. If there are any suggestions or recommendations, please do tell me.
* I would like to extend my gratitude to the owners of the graphics, [`fonts`](https://www.dafont.com/04b-19.font?text=Flappy+Bird) and [`audio files`](https://www.sounds-resource.com/mobile/flappybird/sound/5309/) I have used in this project.

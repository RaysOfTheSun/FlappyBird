# FlappyBird
* This is a reacreation of the game [`Flappy Bird`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flappy_Bird) by [`.GEARS`](https://www.dotgears.com/).
* This can be played using a web browser. [`Play now!`](https://raysofthesun.github.io/FlappyBird/) 
* The game was coded in both __Python__ and __JavaScript__.
* The source code for the JavaScript port can be found in the __docs__ folder. While, on the other hand, the Python source code can be found in the __Python__ folder.
# Notes
* This project used libraries such as [`Pygame`](https://www.pygame.org/news) and [`Pathlib`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html) for the Python version.
* The [`p5.js`](https://p5js.org/) library and the [`Simple cookie framework`](https://github.com/madmurphy/cookies.js) was used in the JavaScript version.
* I would like to extend my gratitude to the owners of the graphics, [`fonts`](https://www.dafont.com/04b-19.font?text=Flappy+Bird) and [`audio files`](https://www.sounds-resource.com/mobile/flappybird/sound/5309/) I have used in this project.
* This is the first actual game that I've coded. If there are any suggestions or recommendations, please do tell me.
